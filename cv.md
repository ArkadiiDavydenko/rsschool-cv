About Me
I work as a research engineer in the defense industry. This profession has given me a lot of experience in conducting complex engineering projects, coordinating them, and the ability to work with technical documentation. At this stage, I do not see any new prospects for myself in this area.

I am a person who is constantly developing, engaged in training. I have a technical and analytical mindset, and the IT sphere has always been close and interesting to me, and now I see my growth in this direction. In addition, IT for me is an opportunity for self-development, world progress, motivation and a decent level of remuneration. Therefore, at the moment I am studying at RS school on Frontend Development.
